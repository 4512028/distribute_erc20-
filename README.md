distribute erc20 

 

T3- Write smart contracts to randomly distribute erc20 tokens to at least 200 addresses. We will decide the amount to distribute initially. The distribution of token should be in such way:

First 25% will receive 40% of the total amount equally.

Second 25% will receive 30% of the total amount equally.

Third 25% will receive 20% of the total amount equally.

Remaining 25% will receive 10% of the total amount equally.

All calculations must be done inside the smart contract. We only pass the addresses and the amount to distribute.
